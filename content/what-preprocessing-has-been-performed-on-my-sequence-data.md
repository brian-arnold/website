Summary: 
By default, reads from Illuminaâ€™s NextSeq are preprocessed to remove adapter sequences. If your downstream analysis requires all reads to have a fixed length, this processing can be suppressed. No adapter trimming or other preprocessing is performed on reads generated by the HiSeq machines.
