**Postdoctoral Position in Brood Parasite Genomics** 

We are hiring a postdoctoral fellow to work on comparative and population genomics of brood parasitic birds. The successful candidate will use multiple, newly generated, high quality genome assemblies and population resequencing data to understand the genomic basis of convergent evolution in avian brood parasite phenotypes across multiple time scales and potential consequence for the dynamics of sex chromosome evolution. This is an NSF-funded position, to be jointly mentored by Michael Sorenson at Boston University and Tim Sackton at Harvard University. The postdoctoral fellow will also have extensive opportunity to interact with collaborators, including Chris Balakrishnan (East Carolina University), Wes Warren (University of Missouri), and Jeff DaCosta (Boston College). Funding is available for up to 2 years, with the second year contingent on successful performance. 

##Qualifications 

The preferred candidate will have a PhD in evolutionary biology, genomics, population genetics, or a related field, with a demonstrated record of research achievement (via publications or preprints). 

They will also be proficient with programming in a scripted language (e.g. R, Python, or Perl). 

Experience will shell scripting and computing cluster environments and/or experience working with whole genome datasets in population or comparative genomics will be beneficial, but is not required. 

##Working Environment 

The successful candidate will split their time between Tim Sackton's Bioinformatics group at Harvard and the Sorenson lab at Boston University. The exact logistics are flexible and will depend on the candidates interests and experience, but in any case the postdoctoral associate will have an opportunity to gain experience and training in bioinformatics, population genetics, comparative genomics, and ornithology. The combined experience of our groups spans a wide range of topics and provides an outstanding opportunity for training, collaboration, and scientific growth. The larger scientific environment in Boston is unparalleled and provides numerous opportunities for engagement, including the [Boston Area Evolutionary Supergroup](http://bit.ly/2MqplU2) and numerous seminar series and journal clubs. Contact Preferred start date would be early 2019, but there is flexibility around this. To apply, please send a CV and cover letter describing interest and previous experience to Tim Sackton and Michael Sorenson. 

*We are committed to diversity and especially encourage members of underrepresented communities to apply.*
