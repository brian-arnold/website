Summary:
The Odyssey 2.0 cluster serves Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS) and School of Public Health (HSPH). To access the cluster, you must first request a Research Computing (RC) [account](https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/account-access-request-forms/). Your PI will receive an e-mail to approve your request. Next, familiarize yourself with how to use [SLURM](https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/resources/running-jobs/) to submit jobs to the cluster. For help getting started with Linux, see RC’s [tutorials](https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/education/).
