Summary: Adding a new PD_Method_File

1.  Go to the Add Menu -> Bogdan MS -> PD_Method_File    

    ![PD method file]({filename}/images/msprl-pd-method-file.png)               
    
    If you don't see this menu then you're not an Admin and won't be able to do this.  Ask Bogdan or Michele for access in this case. 
    
2.  Enter the name (there will be an auto-generated one but delete that)     
    
    ![PD method form]({filename}/images/add-pd-method-file-form.png)           
    
3. Press Save. 
    
    ![Save PD method file]({filename}/images/save-pd-method-file.png)
