Summary: Software support at FAS Informatics

FAS Informatics deploys a significant portion of the software available on the 
[Odyssey cluster](http://portal.rc.fas.harvard.edu/apps/modules/).

In addition, there is in-house expertise with modern bioinformatics tools 
and pipelines like [Trinity](tag/trinity.html) and [RSEM](tag/rsem.html)

Data management services are primarily through the [MiniLIMS](/tag/minilims.html) and up-coming [IggyBase](https://github.com/harvardinformatics/iggybase) LIMS platform.
