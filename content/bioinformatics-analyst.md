The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Informatics department at Harvard University, in collaboration with the Dulac lab in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, is looking for a bioinformatician for genomics analysis, with a focus on single cell RNA-seq analysis. This position will be 100% dedicated to ongoing, NIH-funded projects in the Dulac lab to catalog and understand the diversity and function of cell types in the mouse brain using single-cell RNA-seq and other cutting edge techniques. This is an exciting opportunity to be a key member of an interdisciplinary team that will revolutionize our understanding of the way brains function.
 
Based within the Informatics group at Harvard, the successful candidate will:
 
* Work closely with Dulac lab graduate students, postdocs, and collaborators to derive novel biological insights from large scale RNA-seq data
* Lead bioinformatics efforts to analyze novel single-cell RNA-seq datasets
* Use statistical methods to uncover neural circuits underlying survival functions in the mouse brain
 
The successful candidate will be someone with a strong background in RNA-seq analysis, bioinformatics, and statistics, but no background in neuroscience is required or expected. Candidates who are curious and willing to learn will have numerous opportunities to do so.
 
### Basic Qualifications
Masters degree or higher in bioinformatics, computer science, genomics, or a related field, with at least 5 years hands-on experience with bioinformatics methods
Expertise in programming languages commonly used in bioinformatics (such as Python or R)

### Additional Qualifications
PhD in a relevant field is strongly preferred
Expertise in the analysis of RNA-seq data, prior experience with single-cell RNA-seq data preferred
Fluency with Linux shell scripting and high performance computing

### Additional Information
This is a five-year term position contingent upon continued grant funding and satisfactory performance.

We are committed to diversity and especially encourage members of underrepresented communities to apply.
